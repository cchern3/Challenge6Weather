# Challenge 6
## Description

This week's challenge focuses on creating a weather dashboard that displays the current and the following 5 day forecast of any city being searched. JQuery, bootstrap, moment, css, and javascript were all utilized during this challenge. 

## Usage
The user begins searching for the desired city in the search bar of the webpage then clicking "enter city" to display today's forecast along with the following five days. The user's previous searches will be displayed at the bottom of the submit button, and can be presented again after clicking the previous searched city.

To examine and view the web porfolio page, click on the URL at the bottom of the README.md page. Additionally, the source code of the web page can be displayed in Chrome DevTools, which can be accessed by right clicking and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing 'Command+Option+I' (MacOS) or 'Control+Shift+I" (Windows).
